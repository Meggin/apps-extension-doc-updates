==========================

Scripts to check for apps and extension doc updates

*** api-page.py ***
This script writes the 'Index of /trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/api (filtered by revision downward)
to a file called apiPage.html. The latest changes made to each app and extension is displayed on this page.
The goal is to create a new file which includes the change within each of these latest revisions.
I also want to play with matching to isolate content of interest and make it easier to read.
